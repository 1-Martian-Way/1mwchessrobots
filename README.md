About:
This repo contains the source code to RoboTeamX Chess Robots (later renamed to 1MW Chess Robots).

The Story:
The 1 Martian Way RoboTeamX Chess Robots (RCR) were invented by Karan Kamdar while he was getting his Masters' Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of California, Irvine. 

Karan started from a small dorm room with the fantastic dream of building a large scale chess set and autonomous distributed intelligence which would rival any human team.

Karan sold his vision to Mr. Peter Shikli, CEO of Bizware Applications who was running a chess company called as MegaChess which sold large scale chess pieces. After that it was like a match made in heaven with Karan working day in and day out to build the entire team of robots and the chess board in the basement of Mr. Shikli's house in San Clemente, California. Peter got in the deals and funded the project while Karan solved a host of technical issues. 

The RCR debuted at the Discovery Science Center in Orange County, CA on August 15th, 2009 and beat a team of humans in their very first game. It made several appearances at major places and theme parks such as LegoLand California creating quite a buzz in the country. It was also covered widely by the media with CBS and Orange County Register making first hand videos of the Bots in action. The story has also been published across various digital media channels, online blogs and websites alike.

Since then RCR has been acquired as a brand by 1 Martian Way Corporation (1MW), a drones and robotics business in Mumbai, India. 
The source code was officially made open source on 26th Jan, 2020.

Future Work:
The initial foundation and demonstration of our team of autonomous chess playing robots has been done and now the idea is to make it even more sophisticated and intelligent to compete against a team of human players.
We invite everyone who's interested in this project to learn about it and contribute to it.
